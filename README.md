Hello, everyone! @SolatoroboHacking here. This is my new Github account dedicated to reverse engineering the inner workings of the Nintendo DS game Solatorobo: Red the Hunter.

I will be documenting everything about the game's assets and data, and may even end up starting a decompilation in the near future. If necessary/convenient, I will be building custom
tools to assist in modifying the game. Those tools, along with any discoveries I make, will be uploaded in various repositories on this profile.

The goal is to open up this brilliant game to the modding community so that someone far more talented and experienced than me will come along and make the sequel to this game that it
deserves.

I hope the work I do here will make this game more accessible to everyone, and that someone will finally continue this incredible story.
